        		<p> things that i have done (but mostly things that i want to do and the things i need to learn how to do to do them)</p>
				<dl>
				  <dt class="project" value="1">what lirr line should i take</dt>
				  <dd> 
				  because some people can't read maps or schedules (daron) and because MTA app/website readability sucks <br>
				  also because a) tests how well i can search strings and b) return multiple results, along with timetables <br>
				  can also completely do in python
				  <ol> 
				  	<li> â˜‘ download LIRR data</li>
				  	<li> put into strings / arrays / what would be the neatest way to keep track of this </li>
				  		<ul>
				  			<li>python csv import</li>
				  			<li> in which i discover i haven't installed python or anything on my desktop because i've just been doing everything at work </li>
				  		</ul>
				  	<li> write function that searches arrays for station names and returns (p ez) </li>
				  	<li> write function that returns # of stations in between because people like knowing that kind of thing </li>
				  	<li> schedule data
				  		<ul> 
				  		<li> static schedule data - get time for machine or ask for departure time? or arrival time</li>
				  		<li> once that is done, try to integrate real-time arrival data </li>
				  		</ul>
				  	</li>
				  	<li> return all lines that one can take from that station within the selected hour? </li>
				  	</ol>
				  	</dd>
				  <dt class="project" value="2">theoretical fastest mta ride</dt>
				  <dd> gives you the fastest route in between two stations (including transfers from express to local, e.g. 4/5 -> 6 ) <br>
				  have to learn how to draw things on a map, integrate with mapbox, and linear optimization. also maximizing transfers when needed.
				  <ol>
				  	<li> download MTA gtfs data</li>
				  	<li> plot station / line data on mapbox (or cartoDB) </li>
				  	<li> that probably requires learning javascript to use mapbox.js </li>
				  	<li> learn javascript</li>
				  	<li> too complicated to list out after. do not understand mapbox or javascript yet so not planning but still planning </li>
				  	<li> have to figure out typical route time, headways, and dwell time at stations</li>
				  	<li> would also be interesting to predict how filled a station / train would be at a certain time based on cars, predicted capacity of train, and station usage stats. maybe another project. </li>
				  </ol>
				  </dd>
				  <dt class="project" value ="3">howfuckedismta</dt>
				  <dd> <a href="http://howfuckedismetro.com">the inspiration.</a> the wonder. the amazeballs.</dd>
