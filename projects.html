				  <dt class="project" value="1"><a href="/map">non-voting electorate map</a></dt>
				  election maps are typically presented as red and blue, but a significant portion of the american electorate does not vote.<br>
				  goal: create a map that presents the ratios of democrats, republicans, and non-voting electorate in an easily digestable manner <br>
				  <ol> 
				  	<li> â˜‘ load mapbox map in </li>
				  	<li> figure out how to store election data </li>
					<li> create tabular and graphical election data summary / ratios for info box </li>
				  	<li> create scalable info box for web and mobile </li>
				  	<li> center zoom and selection on given zip code </li>
				  	</ol>
				  	
					
				  <dt class="project" value="2">theoretical fastest mta ride</dt>
				  gives you the fastest route in between two stations (including transfers from express to local, e.g. 4/5 -> 6 ) <br>
				  have to learn how to draw things on a map, integrate with mapbox, and linear optimization. also maximizing transfers when needed.
				  <ol>
				  	<li> download MTA gtfs data</li>
				  	<li> plot station / line data on mapbox (or cartoDB) </li>
				  	<li> that probably requires learning javascript to use mapbox.js </li>
				  	<li> learn javascript</li>
				  	<li> too complicated to list out after. do not understand mapbox or javascript yet so not planning but still planning </li>
				  	<li> have to figure out typical route time, headways, and dwell time at stations</li>
				  	<li> would also be interesting to predict how filled a station / train would be at a certain time based on cars, predicted capacity of train, and station usage stats. maybe another project. </li>
				  </ol>
				  
				  <dt class="project" value ="3">howfuckedismta</dt>
				  <a href="http://howfuckedismetro.com">the inspiration.</a> the wonder. the amazeballs.
				  <br>
				  <dt class="project" value ="4">skincare ingredients</dt>
				  pull skincare ingredients from database (r/asianbeauty faves) and see which ones are irritants? pretty much just another string search, although maaybe also would need to filter/maintain ingredients list
